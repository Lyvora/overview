## 🧭 Strategic Notes

- The roadmap may evolve based on real feedback and testnet results  
- Token and DAO will only launch after practical validation  
- Airdrops will prioritize real users — not bots or task grinders  
- Everything will follow Lyvora’s core principles: utility, transparency, and decentralization
