## The Decentralized Marketplace for Real-World Commerce
**No middlemen. No borders. No abusive fees.**

### The first decentralized marketplace for real-world products — no abusive fees, no bureaucracy, and full freedom to buy and sell with crypto.

Lyvora is a new alternative to traditional digital commerce.  
No subscriptions. No account freezing. No geographic limits — unless chosen by the user.  
With a flat 2.5% fee and transparent on-chain reputation, the platform gives control and profits back to the real protagonists: sellers and buyers.

## 🌍 Our Vision

Lyvora isn’t just another Web3 marketplace — it’s a real shift in the global commerce model.

We created this platform with a clear purpose: to combine the global reach of traditional marketplaces with the power of decentralization, transparency, and freedom.  
Our mission is to eliminate middlemen, slash abusive fees, and give full control to people — not platforms.

Everything happens on-chain: listings, purchases, reviews, reputation.  
With direct crypto payments, no KYC, no hidden fees, and an accessible experience — even for Web2 users.

We are building SUI’s strongest real-world use case:  
**real commerce, with real people and real products.**

Lyvora doesn’t aim to be the “Amazon of Web3.”  
It’s a **reset button** — for global commerce, rebuilt around people.
